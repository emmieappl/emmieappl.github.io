Hello there! I am a Pomona College class of 2025 Molecular Biology major and Japanese minor. Currently, I am working as an undergraduate researcher in the Liu Lab studying mannitol-driven biofilm formation in *Vibrio cholerae*. Outside of the lab, I am a captain for the Pomona-Pitzer Swimming & Diving team.
