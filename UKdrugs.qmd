This data set includes the drugs considered for authorization in the European Union between 1995 and 2023. A generic medicine is developed to be the same as a medicine that has already been authorized, with the same active ingredient(s) and dosage(s) to treat the same condition(s). Accelerated assessment indicates that the medicine is a major interest for public health, so its timeframe for review is 150 evaluation days rather than 210.

```{r}
tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load('2023-03-14')

drugs <- tuesdata$drugs

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(drugs, aes(y = generic)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill = accelerated_assessment)) +
  labs(
    y = "Generic Medicine",
    x = "Drug Count",
    fill = "Accelerated Assessment"
  )
```
